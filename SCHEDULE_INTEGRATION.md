- **Schedule Options**: Complete day/time/type configurations

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to mock data when backend is unavailable
- User-friendly messages indicating demo mode
- Full functionality preserved in offline state

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Backend Setup (Optional)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

## 📊 Data Flow

### Creating a Recurring Ride
```
User Input → Form Validation → API Call → Database → Success Response → UI Update
```

### Loading Recurring Rides
```
App Launch → API Call → Database Query → JSON Response → State Update → UI Render
```

### Demo Mode Fallback
```
API Call → Network Error → Mock Data Load → State Update → UI Render + Demo Banner
```
